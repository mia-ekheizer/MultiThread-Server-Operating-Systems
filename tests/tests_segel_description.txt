Tests Summary:
here you can find a general description of each test. you will also find a simillar test summary at the end of your logfile.log which you can find in your feedback.
if you got a 0, your code probabliy didn't compile due to missing files.
if you failed the headers test, make sure you don't have an empty line before the last header.

there are some tests that we didn't include in the final grade calculations due to thier low pass rate.

test build: (not included in grades calculations)
 build project using make

The following 21 tests have an equal weight, each passed test contributes 5 points to your grade out of 105, a maximal grade that one can get: 

test basic: // PASS
 check if the webserver can serve requests

test locks3: // FAIL DUE TO CONNECTION ERROR
 sends many concurrent requests to test locking. server params: threads 64, Q_size 128. 50 clients each requesting ['/home.html', '/output.cgi?0.3', '/favicon.ico', '/output.cgi?0.2'], 6 times

test locks4: // FAIL DUE TO CONNECTION ERROR
 sends many concurrent requests to test locking. server params: threads 25, Q_size 27. 20 clients each requesting ['/output.cgi?0.01', '/output.cgi?0.02', '/output.cgi?0.005'], 20 times

test equal: // FAIL DUE TO CONNECTION ERROR
 equal buffers and threads server params: threads 8, Q_size 8. 20 clients each requesting ['/home.html', '/output.cgi?0.3', '/favicon.ico'], 10 times

test equal2: // FAIL DUE TO CONNECTION ERROR
 equal buffers and threads server params: threads 32, Q_size 32. 32 clients each requesting ['/home.html', '/output.cgi?0.3', '/favicon.ico'], 20 times

test equal3: // FAIL DUE TO CONNECTION ERROR
 equal buffers and threads server params: threads 16, Q_size 16. 12 clients each requesting ['/home.html', '/output.cgi?0.3', '/favicon.ico'], 20 times

test fewer: // FAIL
 fewer buffers than threads server params: threads 16, Q_size 8. 20 clients each requesting ['/home.html', '/output.cgi?0.3', '/favicon.ico'], 20 times

test drop_head: // FAIL DUE TO CONNECTION ERROR
 testing a drop head policy by counting the number of accepted requests. server params: 2 threads, Q_size: 8, policy: drop head.       
 the client sends 14 concurrent requests. the first two should be handled immediatly, 2-8 should be in waiting but recieving requests 9-14 will cause requests 2-8 to be dropped.

test drop_tail: // FAIL
 testing a drop tail policy by counting the number of accepted requests. server params: 2 threads, Q_size: 8, policy: drop tail.       
 the client sends 12 concurrent requests. the first two should be handled immediatly, 6 should be in waiting and the 9th-12th requests will be dropped.

test drop_random:
 testing a drop random policy by counting the number of accepted requests. server params: 2 threads, Q_size: 8, policy: drop random.       
 the client sends 9 concurrent requests. the first two should be handled immediatly, 6 should be in waiting and the 9th request will trigger the random drop, which should drop 0.25*6 =ciel(1.5)=2 requests top drop.

test stats_all_count: // PASS
 check stats_thread_count if correct sending 8 requests 4 of which are dynamic and 4 static.

test stats_dynamic_count: // PASS
 check stats_static_count if correct sending 8 requests 4 of which are dynamic.

test stats_static_count: // PASS
 check stats_static_count if correct sending 8 requests 4 of which are static.

test stats_distpatch_time: // PASS
 check stats: dispatch time should be greater than 1 secs when sending 1sec 4 dynamic requests. the server only has 2 worker threads.
